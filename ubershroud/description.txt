This mod aims to add more content to the Shroud events and system.
No attempt is made to balance this, it is not the aim here.

This mod also abuses Unity as a resource for more than unlocking traditions.
It is basically also used as a currency in the Shroud.

I.e. Spiritualists may end up burning it all in the Shroud rather then getting more traditions, since it may be more lucrative.

[h1][b]Shroud Features[/b][/h1]
[list]
	[*]Either energy or unity can be used to enter the Shroud.
	[*]You can choose to breach the Shroud while the cooldown is active, but doing so is expensive. Costing both Unity and Energy, more than usual, and no discounts apply.
	[*]You gain experience as you use the Shroud. Initially you can only explore the Shroud as normal.
	[*]At higher levels of Shroud experience there are more options for what to do in the Shroud.
	[*]Some options are less random, but require additional payments.
	[*]Options for harming your enemies rather than buffing yourself exists.
	[*]Having a patron has some additional benefits.
	[*]Hidden patrons available.
	[*]Overhauled The Reckoning.
	[*]AI empires that have transcended are now capable of obtaining Shroud Patrons. Ethics and civics influence which Patrons are picked.
	[*]AI empires can even seal a deal with The End. If crisis is allowed.
